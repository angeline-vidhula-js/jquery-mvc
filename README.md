# JQuery-MVC
An MVC architecture using JQuery for JS functions and DOM manipulations, and JSRender for templating.

JQuery v 1.11.2
JSRender beta release, currently moving towards V1.0

#Note
This repo is a WIP. I created this particular MVC modularization of JQuery for a project, which I am modifying and optimizing before pushing it fully into GitHub.
