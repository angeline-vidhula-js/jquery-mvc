# JQuery-MVC
An MVC architecture using JQuery for JS functions and DOM manipulations, and JSRender for templating.
_Primarily ideated and created for my intranet dashboard project for a Retail client._<br/>

<h3>Dependancies</h3>
- JQuery version 1.11.2

<h3>Demo</h3>
A working demo can be found <a href="http://angeline-vidhula-js.github.io/jquery-mvc/">here</a> with all latest updates.

<h3>Note</h3>
This repo is a **WIP**. I created this particular MVC modularization of JQuery for a project, which I am modifying and optimizing before pushing it fully into GitHub.
_So, I got completely miffed with JQuery templates and all other template engines and decided to write a simple one for my use. Everything is still being modified._
