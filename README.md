# JQuery-MVC
An MVC architecture using JQuery for JS functions and DOM manipulations, and JSRender for templating.

JQuery v 1.11.2

JSRender beta release, currently moving towards V1.0

#Demo
A working demo can be found <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a> with all latest updates.

#Note
This repo is a WIP. I created this particular MVC modularization of JQuery for a project, which I am modifying and optimizing before pushing it fully into GitHub.
